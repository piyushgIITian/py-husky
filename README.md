> Git hooks made easy for Python projects

**python-husky** improves your commits and more 🐶 _woof!_

Inspired by the amazing [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) tool for Node.js, py-husky brings the same awesome Git hooks experience to Python developers.

## The Problem python-husky Solves

### The Missing Step That Breaks Everything

Most Git hook tools (like `pre-commit`) require a **two-step process**:

1. ✅ Install the package: `pip install pre-commit`
2. ❌ **Run install command**: `pre-commit install` ← **Developers forget this!**

**The Result?** Hooks don't work, and developers don't even know it.

### Why This Happens

When you add a package to `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`:
```txt
pre-commit==3.5.0
```

And run `pip install -r requirements.txt`, the package installs but **hooks are NOT automatically set up**. Developers must remember to run an additional command, which often gets missed, especially when:
- Onboarding new team members
- Cloning the repository on a new machine
- Switching between projects
- After cleaning the environment

### python-husky's Solution: Zero Extra Steps

**python-husky automatically installs hooks when the package is installed!**

```bash
pip install python-husky
```

That's it! If `.py-husky/` directory exists in your project, hooks are automatically installed. No extra command needed.

### How It Works

1. **During Installation**: py-husky checks for `.py-husky/` directory
2. **Automatic Setup**: If found, Git hooks are automatically configured
3. **Zero Friction**: Developers get working hooks without knowing it

### But Wait, There's More!

If `.py-husky/` wasn't present during installation (e.g., you added it later), you can still run:

```bash
py-husky install
```

This gives you the flexibility of manual installation when needed, while providing automatic installation by default.

### Real-World Impact

**Before py-husky:**
```bash
git clone repo
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Oops! Forgot to run pre-commit install
git commit -m "bad code"  # ❌ No checks run!
```

**With python-husky:**
```bash
git clone repo
pip install -r requirements.txt  # ✅ Hooks automatically installed!
git commit -m "code"  # ✅ Checks run automatically!
```

### Comparison

| Tool | Install Package | Setup Hooks | Hooks Work? |
|------|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| pre-commit | `pip install pre-commit` | `pre-commit install` ⚠️ | Only if you remember step 2 |
| python-husky | `pip install python-husky` | ✅ Automatic! | Always! |

## Features

✨ **Easy Setup** - Initialize Git hooks with a single command  
🎯 **Simple Configuration** - File-based hooks just like Husky  
🔧 **Flexible** - Support for all Git hooks (pre-commit, pre-push, commit-msg, etc.)  
🚀 **Lightweight** - Minimal dependencies, maximum functionality  
🐍 **Python Native** - Built for Python projects, by Python developers  
📦 **PyPI Ready** - Easy installation via pip  

## Installation

```bash
pip install py-husky
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize py-husky in your project

```bash
cd your-project
py-husky init
```

This creates:
- `.py-husky/` directory for your hook scripts
- Git hooks in `.git/hooks/`

### 2. Add your hooks

Create hook files directly in `.py-husky/` or use the CLI:

```bash
# Using CLI
py-husky add pre-commit "black ." "flake8"

# Or create files manually
echo '#!/bin/sh
black .
flake8 .' > .py-husky/pre-commit

chmod +x .py-husky/pre-commit
```

### 3. That's it! 🎉

Your hooks will now run automatically when you commit or push.

## Usage

### Initialize py-husky

```bash
py-husky init
```

### Add hooks via CLI

```bash
# Add a pre-commit hook
py-husky add pre-commit "black ." "flake8"

# Add a pre-push hook
py-husky add pre-push "pytest tests/"
```

### List all hooks

```bash
py-husky list-hooks
```

### Install hooks (useful after cloning)

```bash
py-husky install
```

### Uninstall hooks

```bash
py-husky uninstall
```

## Configuration

### Hook Files

Create shell scripts directly in `.py-husky/` directory:

```bash
# .py-husky/pre-commit
#!/bin/sh

echo "Running custom pre-commit hook..."
black .
flake8 .

if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Pre-commit checks failed!"
    exit 1
fi
```

Make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x .py-husky/pre-commit
```

## Supported Hooks

py-husky supports all Git hooks:

- `pre-commit` - Run before commit
- `pre-push` - Run before push
- `commit-msg` - Validate commit messages
- `pre-rebase` - Run before rebase
- `post-checkout` - Run after checkout
- `post-merge` - Run after merge
- `prepare-commit-msg` - Prepare commit message

## Common Use Cases

### Code Formatting

```bash
# .py-husky/pre-commit
#!/bin/sh
black .
isort .
```

### Linting

```bash
# .py-husky/pre-commit
#!/bin/sh
flake8 src/
pylint src/
mypy src/
```

### Testing

```bash
# .py-husky/pre-push
#!/bin/sh
pytest tests/ -v
pytest tests/ --cov --cov-report=term-missing
```

### Commit Message Validation

```bash
# .py-husky/commit-msg
#!/bin/sh
python scripts/validate_commit_msg.py "$1"
```

Example validation script:

```python
# scripts/validate_commit_msg.py
import sys
import re

with open(sys.argv[1], 'r') as f:
    commit_msg = f.read()

pattern = r'^(feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|test|chore)(\(.+\))?: .{1,50}'

if not re.match(pattern, commit_msg):
    print("❌ Invalid commit message format!")
    print("Format: <type>(scope): <subject>")
    print("Example: feat(auth): add login functionality")
    sys.exit(1)

print("✅ Commit message is valid")
```

### Security Scanning

```bash
# .py-husky/pre-commit
#!/bin/sh
bandit -r src/
safety check
```

## Advanced Features

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging:

```bash
export PY_HUSKY_DEBUG=1
git commit -m "test"
```

### Skip Hooks

Skip hooks for a single commit:

```bash
git commit -m "urgent fix" --no-verify
```

### Project-Specific Configuration

Each project can have its own `.py-husky/` hook files, making it easy to share hook configurations across teams via version control.

## Integration with CI/CD

Add to your `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = [
    "py-husky>=0.1.0",
    "black>=22.0.0",
    "flake8>=4.0.0",
    "pytest>=7.0.0",
]
```

In your CI pipeline:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
py-husky install
```

## Acknowledgments

This project is inspired by [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) by [typicode](https://github.com/typicode), which revolutionized Git hooks for Node.js developers. py-husky brings that same elegant experience to the Python ecosystem.

**Why py-husky?**

While Husky is excellent for Node.js projects, Python developers needed a native solution that:
- Works without Node.js dependencies
- Integrates seamlessly with Python tooling (black, flake8, pytest, mypy, etc.)
- Follows Python packaging standards (PyPI, pip)
- Uses simple shell scripts for hooks (just like Husky)

py-husky is an independent project developed by [Piyush Gautam](https://github.com/piyushgIITian), maintaining the same philosophy as Husky: making Git hooks easy and accessible for everyone.

If you find Husky's approach useful, consider checking out the [original Husky project](https://github.com/typicode/husky).
